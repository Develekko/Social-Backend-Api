## üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following tools and technologies installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Atom](https://atom.en.uptodown.com/windows), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads) for API Documentation


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To install and run your social media backend API, follow these steps:

<h2>1. Clone the repository</h2>

```
git clone https://github.com/Develekko/Social-Backend-Api.git
cd Social-Backend-Api
```

<h2>2. Install dependencies</h2>

```
npm install

```
<h2>3. Set up environment variables</h2>

> Note: **environment variables(.env) located into config file**

```
PORT=<Your_PORT_Number>
DB_URL=<mongodb_url>
BARER_KEY=<BEARER>
TOKEN_SIGNATURE=<SIGNATURE>
CONFIRM_EMAIL_SIGNAUTRE=<SIGNATURE>
SALT_ROUNDS=<SALT_ROUNDS>
GMAIL_EMAIL=<GMAIL_EMAIL>
GMAIL_PASSWORD=<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>
CLOUDINARY_NAME=<CLOUDINARY_NAME>
CLOUDINARY_KEY=<CLOUDINARY_KEY>
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=<CLOUDINARY_SECRET>
INTERNET_INFO=https://ipgeolocation.abstractapi.com/v1/?api_key=<ABSTRACT_API_KEY>
```

- Replace `<Your_PORT_Number>` with the port number you want your server to listen on , for example (5000)
- Replace `<mongodb_url>` with your MongoDB Cloud URL
> Note: To get `MongoDB` the  Cloud URL, follow these steps through [URL](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string)
- Replace `<BEARER>` with any secret key for example (**bearer_{Token}**)
- Replace `<SIGNATURE>` with any secret key for example (**UhzOXjiSgTWDZbXUSRnh**)
> Note: In JSON Web Tokens (JWT), the signature is a string of characters that is used to verify the authenticity of the token.
- Replace `<SALT_ROUNDS>` with number between 1-20
> Note: A commonly used hashing algorithm for password storage is bcrypt, and a minimum of 10 salt rounds is generally recommended.
However, some security experts recommend using a higher number of salt rounds
, such as 12 or 14, to provide additional security against brute-force attacks. [Read More...](https://medium.com/coinmonks/to-salt-or-not-to-salt-salting-is-not-the-only-answer-to-securing-passwords-cdab26bd20ad)
- Replace `<GMAIL_EMAIL>` with your Google Account
- Replace `<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>` with your Google App password
> Note: follow these steps : [URL](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
- Replace `<CLOUDINARY_NAME>`, `CLOUDINARY_KEY`,`CLOUDINARY_SECRET` with keys in your  [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) Account .  Follow these steps on this [URL](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary#1_create_your_account_and_set_up_your_product_environment)
> ![image](https://i.imgur.com/9TndYUV.png)
- Replace `ABSTRACT_API_KEY` with  your own api key through [URL](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation-api)

<h2>4. Start the server</h2>

```
nodemon [your node app]  or  nodemon
```
or
```
npm run dev
```



## üìñ API Documentation
The API documentation is provided through [Postman JSON File](./Social-Backend-Api.postman_collection.json)

<h3>Follow These Steps</h3>

## üöÄ Deployment

>Before you begin, Make sure that you don't have any issues or errors before deploying your project.

>You need to remove `config` or `.env` file before deployment because of the sensitive data.

<h3>What do you need ?</h3>

1. Create a run script in the `package.json` file [Here](./package.json/#L9)

```json
"scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
    },
```

2. Add an "engines" section to your `package.json` file [Here](./package.json/#L12)

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "16.14.0"
},
```

>Note : To check the version of Node.js installed on your system, you can use the node -v command.

```
node -v
```

3. Create a `vercel.json` file and put it in the root of your project folder and then add the code below

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
       { "src": "./index.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }
    ],
    "routes": [
        {
          "src": "/(.*)",
          "dest": "/"
        }
      ]
 }
```

4. For our Deployment , we gonna use [vercel](https://vercel.com) 

>Note: Vercel is a cloud platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. It provides a seamless deployment experience for front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as serverless functions and full-stack applications.

- Follow these steps from [Ada Cheng](https://dev.to/adafycheng/deploy-nodejs-application-to-vercel-in-5-minutes-171m#create-a-vercel-project) article 

- Once you reach here, **congratulations!** You deployed your project successfully.

- Finally, you need to do the last important thing: add environment variables to your project through these steps .

1- go to you project settings

![image](https://imgur.com/qzQ9qbb.png)

2- You can either add variables one by one,¬† copy and paste the whole file, or import your `.env` file [Read More](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

3- After submitting your environment variables, you may need to redeploy your Vercel project.
